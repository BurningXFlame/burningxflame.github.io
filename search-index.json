XTS minimizes attack surface. Only one public IP-port, i.e. the public IP-port of XTS, of each region is exposed to public networks. XTS protects your services from being exposed to public networks. Your services can only be accessed from within your regions. XTS rejects connections from public networks, except connections from XTS of another region of yours. XTS has builtin abilities to defend against DDoS attacks, to defend against slow attacks, to close idle connections, etc. Adaptive and Fair Hierarchical Transmission Control See ATC for details.\nEffortlessly Scale With Your Business XTS effortlessly scales as your business grows. XTS is Truly Distributed, Load Balanced and Horizontally Scalable. This architecture provides the best scalability and reliability. In theory, there’s no scalability cap, i.e. you can achieve unlimited throughput by specifying an unlimited number of replicas.\nReliability Zero downtime during scaling out/in. Zero downtime during upgrade. All established connections remain intact on config changes. Zero downtime on temporary errors. Auto-recover on temporary errors. Zero downtime on process crash.

Even though your service process exits abnormally, the container keeps alive, because the guardian keeps alive. The guardian launches your service process instantly, and therefore decreases downtime to 0.\nCase 2: Client connections are closed because server process exits.\nProblem: Clients have to re-connect the server.\nBetter Solution: Let the goroutine-level guardian guard your service goroutine. Even though your service exits abnormally, the process keeps alive, because the guardian keeps alive. The guardian launches your service instantly, and therefore decreases downtime to 0.

This is vital to relating goroutines and goroutine local storages. And this is vital to performance. What to use as goroutine local storage? This is vital to performance. How to detect goroutine creation? This is vital to creating goroutine local storage. How to detect goroutine exit? This is vital to removing goroutine local storage instantly and therefore minimizing memory footprint. Minimizing cost to apply goroutine local storage in a legacy codebase. As follows are my choices:\nUse Go Assembly to get the address of the current g (i.e. goroutine), and use it as the ID of the current goroutine. It\u0026rsquo;s extremely fast. See Goroutine ID . Use std Value Context (context.WithValue) as goroutine local storage. In context-passing cases such as distributed tracing, serverless, etc, a goroutine local storage is copied mostly, read mostly, and written rarely.\nValue Context is pointer, and therefore can be copied at almost zero cost.\nValue Context is immutable because it provides no API to modify itself, and therefore is concurrency-safe.\nIn conclusion, Value Context is perfect for goroutine local storage. Use a custom function Go instead of the keyword go to spawn a goroutine. Therefore we know exactly when a goroutine is created or exits. See 3. Use Go AST to create a code generator which scans a codebase and replaces all keyword go with function Go.
